🔍🚀 Day 26 of My JavaScript Journey: Exploring GitHub Profiles with a Search Box!

Today, I dived into the vast world of GitHub, creating a dynamic GitHub Profile Search Box. Here's what I accomplished:

🔗 API Fetching: I mastered the art of fetching GitHub API to dynamically retrieve user profiles, ensuring real-time data.

🕵️‍♂️ Search Box Functionality: I implemented a search box where users can input a GitHub username, providing an interactive way to explore profiles.

Join me as I continue to bridge the gap between web development and the wealth of information on GitHub!
